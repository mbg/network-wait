-- | This module contains computations which wait for some networked service
-- to become available, subject to some retry policy from "Control.Retry".
-- The `waitSocketWith` function is the most general function exported by
-- this module, but several variants exist for convenience. You may wish
-- to start out with e.g. `waitTcp` or `waitSocket` initially and move
-- on to the more feature-rich variants if you need their functionality.

-- | Each individual connect attempt needs a timeout to prevent it from hanging
-- indefinitely. This policy allows us to make that timeout length adaptive,
-- based on the 'RetryStatus' of the outer retry policy.
--
-- Thus, the first attempt to connect will have a short timeout (currently 100ms),
-- and then successive attempts will get longer timeouts via "FullJitter" backoff.
-- The goals of this are twofold:
--
-- 1) If a connect call hangs during the first few attempts, it is timed out quickly
-- and re-attempted, so on a healthy network you aren't penalized too much by the hang.
-- The outer retry policy can control the time between attempts, so the user can set
-- it high enough to make this be the case.
--
-- 2) If the network is slow, we will eventually reach the maximum timeout of 3 seconds,
-- which should be long enough. Note that the popular wait-for script uses 1 second
-- timeouts, so this is extra conservative:
